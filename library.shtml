								<h2>AN ELECTRONIC PUBLICATION<br />
									LISTING ARTICLES, BOOKS, REFERENCES and SERVICES AVAILABLE to SCC MEMBERS<br />
									LAST INDEX UPDATE: 29 December 2003</h2>
								<h2>THE SCC LIBRARY ELECTRONIC INDEX and THE POSTHORN (ISSN-0551;6897) are published by the Scandinavian Collectors Club. ©2000.</h2>
								<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
								<p>This electronic edition of the Library Index is dedicated to collectors who seek to advance their knowledge of Scandinavian philately. The authors of books and journal articles, plus the compilers of material on subjects of our interest, are to be commended. Without them there would be no SCC Library. It is extremely gratifying that so many members sent copies of their exhibits or collections. Slide shows also have helped to stimulate interest especially for chapter meetings. Please remember no accumulation of reference material is of any value unless it is used. (W.E. Melberg, SCC Librarian, 1987-1999.)</p>
